Taking into account such a scenario, an organization's strategy team is generally composed of CS + Finance, Finance students are very good at data analysis, strategy, but not very understanding of the underlying structure of the code, code style and standards are different While CS students are well aware of the code and framework, they are struggling with the financial theory of boring holes, and the current domestic support for quantitative services can not solve this common scene pain points, or for financial students Easy to operate the analysis system, but for IT in terms of the lack of customizable part; either for the underlying IT data and transaction interface, and for financial students want to package out from the underlying interface, a set of available efficient framework It is difficult to ascend to heaven.

QUNATAXIS is committed to solving this problem, and we solve this problem by creating a standard framework within a RESTful-based LAN that is separated from front and back, and we hope that our framework is highly scalable and easy to access The company's individual strategy team's individual needs (this is the most critical, basically every company will have its own data, their own trading interface, their own specific functional goals), so we want to build a standardized, high Scalable, easy to deploy scaffolding, rather than a complete hard to customize solution.

QUANTAXIS front and back completely separated, highly split, each component relies on RESTful standard URI to communicate, which also gives us an open framework of infinite possibilities, can achieve Matlab, r, python, javascript, C, C + +, rust And other users of the harmonious coexistence, rather than increase the cost of learning to learn a common language.At the same time, as long as a public network IP and server, you can also go beyond the LAN restrictions, to achieve the needs of remote teams.
